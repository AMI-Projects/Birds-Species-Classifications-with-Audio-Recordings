# Birds-Species-Classifications-with-Audio-Recordings
The primary objective of this project is to classify bird species based on their vocalizations  using sound recognition techniques. By analysing bird calls and songs, we can automatically  identify different species, which is valuable for ecological research, biodiversity monitoring,  and conservation efforts.
